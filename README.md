# Crop Recommendation System
To address the challenges faced by Indian farmers in crop selection and yield prediction, a 
comprehensive solution is proposed. This system incorporates precision agriculture, mining 
techniques for crop yield prediction, and data-driven decision-making tools.
Employed data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, standardized numerical 
features, and converted data types for efficient processing. Integrated datasets related to 
soil characteristics, climate conditions, and crop production using Dask for parallel 
computing capabilities. Developed machine learning models for crop yield prediction for 
crop production prediction, used Decision Tree Regression and Naive Bayes Classification 
algorithms, as described in the project report.
